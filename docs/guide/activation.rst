Licensing and Activation
------------------------

You can evaluate the Toolkit without charge for 30 days after installation.
When you're ready to purchase the Toolkit, you will receive two pieces of
information: a License ID, and a password.

To activate the Toolkit, simply go to the LabVIEW "Help" menu, and select
"Activate Add-Ons".  Follow the on-screen prompts to either activate directly
over the internet, or, for computers not directly connected to the Internet,
by using a Web browser on another computer.  Telephone activation is not
available at this time.

Once activated, the Toolkit does not expire.  Each license confers the right
to use the Toolkit on a single computer.  Consult your License Agreement for
more information.
