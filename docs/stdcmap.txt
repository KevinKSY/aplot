|enum_in| **Map**
    Colormap to use.  See :ref:`guide_colormaps` for more info.
    
|double_in| **Value Min**
    Lower range for colormapped data; values smaller than this will all be
    plotted with the first color in the colormap.
    
|double_in| **Value Max**
    Upper range for colormapped data; values larger than this will all be
    plotted with the last color in the colormap.
    
|enum_in| **Scaling**
    Colormap scaling mode.  Currently only linear scaling is supported.
    
|bool_in| **Reverse**
    Flip the colormap; for example, if a map has 0.0 as black and 1.0 as
    white, this will assign 0.0 as white and 1.0 as black.
